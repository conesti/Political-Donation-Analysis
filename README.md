# Political-Donation-Analysis

#Note: Numbers are simply estimates.  They are not precise because of the inherent way the data was recorded.  For example, "Republican" could have been recorded as "REP", "rep", "Republican", or maybe even "r" in some cases.  Furthermore there are cadet branches of each party in some of the states.  These are instances which might not have been picked up by the code.
