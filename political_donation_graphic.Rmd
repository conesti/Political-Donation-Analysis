I take data from the FEC website and create a table which displays the total amount donated to each political party by Harvard employees in 2005-2006.

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```{r graph, fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Read in variable from the Rds file 

harvard_donors <- readRDS("harvard_donors.Rds") %>% filter(party %in% c("DEM", "REP"))

#Next the party variable is converted from a chr to a factor

harvard_donors$party <- as.factor(harvard_donors$party)

#One can then rename the levels in the factor for more clarity

levels(harvard_donors$party) <- c("Democrat", "Republican")


#Beginning with the Harvard donors data set

harvard_donors%>% 
  
  #One first groups the data by date since this is essentially a time analysis
  
  group_by(date) %>%
  
  #The next step is to filter out entries that have an NA in the party variable
  
  filter(!is.na(party)) %>%
  
  #Next, one filters out negative or 0 amounts for the donations
  
  filter(amount > 0) %>% 
  
  #One performs a similar NA filter for the date variable
  
  filter(!is.na(date)) %>%
  
  #Next, one can build the plot plotting the amount given per date for each party.  The data is also colored by party for clarity
  
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = amount, fill = party)) +

  geom_col() +

       #The x label is extended to make more sense:
       
       x = "Date of Donations", 
       
       #As is the y label:
       
       y = "Total Amount Given ($)") + 
  
  #Next, the legend is renamed for clarity 
  
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Political Party")) + 
  
  #Also for clarity, parties are given their political colors and the y axis limit is set to a more reasonable level
  
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) + ylim(0, 4500)
